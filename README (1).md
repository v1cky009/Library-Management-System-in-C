# Library Management System in C

Welcome to our Library Management System repository! I've crafted this project using C to make library tasks a breeze. It handles everything from managing books to handling administrative duties with ease. Plus, it's not just for libraries; students can use it as a guide for their own university or college projects. Let's team up to make library management more efficient and reliable!
